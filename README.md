# Marine-Object-Detection-Based-on-YOLO-V8
This study explores the application of YOLOv8 models for marine object detection and classification in diverse weather conditions. Utilising the Singapore Maritime Dataset Plus (SMD+), we developed and compared three custom-trained models: YOLOv8n, YOLOv8m, and YOLOv8m with data augmentation and class weighting. The research addressed challenges such as class imbalance and varying visibility conditions in maritime environments. Our experiments demonstrated significant improvements over pre-trained models, with the augmented YOLOv8m model showing the best performance, particularly in foggy conditions. The study achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.45 for YOLOv8n and 0.55 for YOLOv8m. While the models excelled in detecting vessels and boats across various scenarios, limitations persisted in shallow visibility conditions. This research contributes to advancing maritime safety and surveillance technologies, highlighting the potential of deep learning in enhancing object detection in challenging marine environments.
